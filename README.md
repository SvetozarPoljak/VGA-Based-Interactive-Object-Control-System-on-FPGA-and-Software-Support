The project implements a real-time interactive system on the Zybo Z7 FPGA platform with VGA output.
A user-controlled object moves across the screen, avoiding obstacles and collecting targets.
The system features custom hardware logic for VGA display control alongside software support for configuration, input handling, collision detection and object movement.
The design was developed in Vivado IP Integrator, utilizing the Xilinx Zynq-7000 Processing System, BRAM and custom VGA controller.
Software components were implemented in Vitis, enabling real-time interaction via push buttons and switches.
